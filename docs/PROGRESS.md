# EcoChain Copilot: Project Progress Log

This document tracks progress across all phases, recording what was built, what was measured, and what was deferred.

## Phase 0: Recon, Plan, Skeleton

- **Status:** Complete (Gate Passed)
- **What Was Built:**
  - Environment recon completed and recorded (Python 3.12.10, uv 0.12.17).
  - Pinned `requirements.in` created; recompiled `requirements.txt` with `PyJWT`, `argon2-cffi`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest-cov`, and `pre-commit`.
  - Installed all dependencies into `.venv`.
  - Complete repository layout created matching architectural specifications.
  - Configured `pyproject.toml` (ruff, strict mypy for `backend/app`, pytest, coverage).
  - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `Makefile`, `scripts/check.py`, `.env.example`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - Created initial FastAPI app skeleton in `backend/app/main.py` and test in `backend/tests/unit/test_skeleton.py`.
  - Authored `docs/PLAN.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- **What Was Measured:**
  - Ruff linter: clean (0 errors).
  - Mypy type checker: clean under strict mode on `backend/app` (0 issues).
  - Pytest: 1 test passed in 0.22s.
- **Deviations / Blockers:**
  - System binaries `tesseract`, `redis-cli`, `psql`, `ollama` are not available directly on the Windows host path. Recorded in `docs/PLAN.md`; interface fakes/mocks will be used for unit tests, with Docker Compose providing the containerized environment for integration.
- **Next Phase:** Phase 1: Foundations (Config, domain models, DB schema, tamper-evident audit log).
